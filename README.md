### ðŸ§  Final Project Plan â€“ "FleetIQ: Intelligent Fleet Monitoring System"

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal:

Design and implement a full-stack data science solution for fleet management using:

- **Python ETL scripts**
- **AWS (S3, Lambda, possibly Redshift)**
- **Power BI for reporting**
- **ML models for predictive maintenance**

### âœ… Project Objectives:

| Step | Phase | Objective | Tools/Skills |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Data Engineering** | Build an ETL pipeline: extract CSV data, clean, transform, and load into a database (or AWS S3) | Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy), AWS S3, PostgreSQL |
| 2 | **Exploratory Data Analysis** | Analyze trends (e.g., fuel, speed, maintenance), visualize with Power BI | Python (seaborn, matplotlib), Power BI |
| 3 | **Feature Engineering** | Create derived features (avg fuel usage per trip, failure patterns, etc.) | Python |
| 4 | **ML Model Development** | Build a model for predicting hardware failure or maintenance requirement | Scikit-learn/XGBoost |
| 5 | **Deployment** | Automate the ETL pipeline (locally or via AWS Lambda), create a Power BI dashboard | AWS Lambda, Power BI |
| 6 | **Documentation & Report** | Write a final report and prepare project for GitHub portfolio | Markdown, Notion, Git |
